// üí∞ (test 1) Once you get this error: `User.username -> is marked as @external but is not used`
// Just remove the username field from the User type.

// üê® (test 2) Look at the reviews/resolvers.js . We have the username cached in this service.
// It initially got resolved by the resolvers.User.username function, but now that's skipped.
// If that's the only field we would like to have for a reviewer, it would be nice not to have to request it from the accounts service.
// Add the User.username field back in. Use @provides directive.
